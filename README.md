# AirBnB Clone - Command Interpreter

## Description
This project is the first step toward building a full web application similar to the AirBnB platform. The command interpreter is a basic console that manages AirBnB objects such as `User`, `Place`, `City`, and more. It allows you to create, update, and manage these objects, with functionalities such as saving them to a JSON file and loading them back.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a command-line interface (CLI) application built using Python's `cmd` module. It allows you to manage different types of AirBnB objects.

### How to Start the Interpreter
